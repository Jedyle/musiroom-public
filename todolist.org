* TODO make auth tokens expire after a certain time 
* TODO add pytest with factoryboy


* TODO refactor + pytest
* TODO add i18n language support (for actions / notifications mostly)
* TODO fix the 'append slash' 500 error
* TODO add user rating stats for followees


* ERRORS
** Remove album.cover and .get_cover and use .media_cover everywhere
** 500 error with CreateUserRatingView when object already exists
** When we add a rating, disable the interest for the album by default (backend + frontend)
** Do cases when user is not connected (e.g : show rating in album page ?)
** LastFM api does not give artist image anymore : find another source
** Artist/Albums Page : use placeholders during loading (can be pretty long)
** Search album, artists... takes accents
