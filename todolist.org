* ERRORS
** Remove album.cover and .get_cover and use .media_cover everywhere
** 500 error with CreateUserRatingView when object already exists
** Artist/Albums Page : use placeholders during loading (can be pretty long)
** Search album, artists... takes accents 


* BACKEND
** fix youtube link (find new API key from google console)
** albums : remove references to 'cover' and 'get_cover', replace everything by 'media_cover'
** rename project from 'lamusitheque' to ??? (find name)
** pytest : add tests everytime a bug is fixed
** upgrade python and django (now blocked because of pinax badges)
** LastFM api does not give artist image anymore : find another source
** When we add a rating, disable the interest for the album by default (backend + frontend)

* FRONTEND
** Migrate to NextJS
** Refactor components (remove useless components, remove containers/ folder...)

* DEPLOYMENT
** prepare docker-compose shell for dev and for prod
